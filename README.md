# QuickLook.Plugin.OfficeViewer (Native)

This plugin renders MS Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files with native components provided by existing `Microsoft Office suite` or ~~`WPS Office`~~ (According to the feedback, in most cases, WPS is not supported).

## Differences with [`OfficeViewer`](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook.Plugin.OfficeViewer)

1. **`OfficeViewer-Native` requires an `Microsoft Office suite` or `WPS Office` installation,** whereas `OfficeViewer` does not.
2. `OfficeViewer-Native` renders documents better than ``OfficeViewer`` in most cases.
